Ok the animations will cycle thou at a set durations for reminders to follow the channel and follow your twitter. I can add several other notitifcations if you would like. Let me know what you think. these have no sounds so you should be able to play them in your xsplit. 

When you load in the the only html file that has a delay on start up is the follow.html so you will need to selcet that one. 
after 30s itll show follow.html 
after 100s itll show twitter.html
after 100s itll show youtube.html
after 100s itll show thankyou.html
after 100s itll show follow.html

so after you set the first page itll cycle throu on its own you dont have to change anything 

if you want to change the text on any of it let me know. I do have limited space to work with to keep the height and width correct without lossing the wording off the side.
